<<<<<<< Model
=======
This repository contains code and files related to a machine learning model for image classification using the MobileNet architecture. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of five classes: Mass, Nodule, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model should be organized in the following directory structure:

This is a dataset containing images with a resolution of 224x224 pixels, consisting of 5 different classes. This dataset is used to train and test convolutional neural network models.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Contents
The repository includes the following files:

Mount Drive and Check GPU: Use the notebook Mount Drive dan Cek GPU Colab.ipynb to mount Google Drive and check if a GPU is available on Google Colab.

Count Files: Use the notebook Hitung File yang Digunakan.ipynb to calculate the number of files in each category within the dataset.

Preprocessing and Setting Layer: Use the notebook Preprocessing dan Setting Layer.ipynb to perform data preprocessing and set up the layers of the MobileNet model.

Train Model: Use the notebook Train Model.ipynb to train the MobileNet model on the dataset. The trained model will be saved as MobileNet_90_Adam_model.h5.

Test and Graphs: Use the notebook Test dan Grafik.ipynb to evaluate the trained model on a test dataset and generate classification reports, confusion matrices, and graphs.

Note: Make sure to adjust the file paths in the code according to the location of your dataset.
